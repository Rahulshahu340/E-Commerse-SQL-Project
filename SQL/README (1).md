This repository contains an in-depth analysis of an Ecommerce dataset, focusing on sales performance, customer behavior, operational efficiency, and time trends. 
The project is divided into two phases: **SQL Analysis** and **Data Visualization**, providing actionable insights to drive strategic decision-making.

## **Phase 1: SQL Analysis – Advanced Queries**

### **Objective:**
To perform advanced data analysis using MySQL queries to answer key business questions and extract meaningful insights related to sales, customers, operations, and time trends.

### **Tasks and Questions:**

#### **1. Sales Performance Analysis**
- Calculate **total sales revenue** per category, sub-category, and region.
- Identify the **top 5 best-selling products** by both sales revenue and quantity sold.

#### **2. Customer Insights**
- Find the **most loyal customers** based on purchase frequency and total spend.
- Identify customers with the **highest average order value (AOV)**.

#### **3. Operational Efficiency**
- Analyze **average delivery time** by region.
- Identify **regions or products** with the highest delivery success rates.

#### **4. Date and Time Analytics**
- Determine the **monthly sales trend** for the last two years.
- Analyze **seasonality of sales** to identify peak months.

#### **5. Advanced SQL Queries**
- Use **window functions** to rank products based on sales within each category.
- Calculate **month-to-date (MTD)** and **year-to-date (YTD)** sales metrics.

#### **3. Regional Analysis**
- **Revenue by Region:** Regional sales comparisons.
- **Return Rates by Region:** Percentage of canceled orders.
- **Average Delivery Time by Region:** Operational performance.

#### **4. Operational Metrics**
